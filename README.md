### If you have a dream don't wait, act! - Kingdom 🗝 Hearts

My name's **Akshay**! 👋 Nice to meet you! I am a passionate and self-motivated **Software Developer, AI Enthusiast and Mathematician**. My work interests lie in the interplay between software engineering and data science. I enjoy video-game development and music as hobbies. Ask me about what I am learning today!~ 

👨‍💻 Currently Working at [gojek](https://gojek.io) as a Product Engineer, mostly on the backend and devops technologies. My daily work includes updating my tasks on **jira**, working with the higly scalable backend microservices and lambda actors written in **golang, ruby, clojure and java** attached to **postgreSQL** database and **redis** cache, write loads of tests (sometimes before the code, aka **TDD**), deploying these changes to integration and eventually to production using **Continuous Integration and Git** and ofcourse monitoring them using **NewRelic and Graphana**.        

✨ On the side, I am currently exploring Deep Neural Networks and Web App development using React and NodeJS!
